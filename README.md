## Abstract
*Deepfake synthesis is rapidly advancing, generating hyper-realistic synthetic media that not only challenge digital security but also raise significant ethical concerns. While conventional detection methods based on handcrafted features and standard CNNs often struggle with interpretability and generalization, our research explores a multimodal strategy that integrates both visual and textual cues to enhance detection performance and transparency. Our approach firstly involves the employ of several state-of-the-art vision-language models under zero-shot and few-shot settings, to assess their ability to identify and explain image manipulations. Following these experiments, we fine-tuned a leading multimodal model, refining its capacity to detect tampering and generate human-understandable explanations. To comprehensively gauge the system’s performance, we adopted a multi-faceted and robust evaluation framework that combines traditional NLP and embedding-based metrics with qualitative assessments from large language models acting as expert judges. Overall, our results show that focused fine-tuning not only enhances the precision of deepfake detection, but also improves the interpretability of the generated explanations. Additionally, our findings support the development of a generalized framework for assessing natural language output.*
